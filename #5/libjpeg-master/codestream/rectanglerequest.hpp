    This project implements a complete(!) JPEG (10918-1 ITU.T-81) codec,
    plus a library that can be used to encode and decode JPEG streams. 
    It also implements ISO/IEC 18477 aka JPEG XT which is an extension
    towards intermediate, high-dynamic-range lossy and lossless coding
    of JPEG. In specific, it supports ISO/IEC 18477-3/-6/-7/-8 encoding.

******************************************************************

Defines a rectangular image domain that is requested from the
user to be loaded or to be previewed. Hence, the purpose of
this helper class is to pass parameters about the user request
information down the jpeg stream.

This structure is constructed by the decoder, and sent down
to the band class which will generate the requests for each
code block. On its way, more and more components gets parsed
and get interpreted.
