5.From now on we are using a Compact Version of the BTDH for indexing and retrieval
6.New descriptor (B-CEDD). During the search process, an image query is entered and the system returns images with a similar content. Initially, the similarity/distance between the query and each image in the database is calculated with the B-CEDD descriptor, and only if the distance is smaller than a predefined threshold,the comparison of their CEDDs is performed.
7.Now you can save the retrieval results in trec_eval format
8.Indexing is now working with *.bmp,*.jpg and *.jpg

Demos
9. Binary, nearest-neighbor, one-dimensional automaton demo
The simplest type of cellular automaton is a binary, nearest-neighbor, one-dimensional automaton. Such automata were  called "elementary cellular automata" by S. Wolfram, who has extensively studied their 	amazing properties. There are  256 such automata, each of which can be indexed by a unique binary number whose decimal representation is known as the  "rule" for the particular automaton. 
10. A cellular automaton demo for the propagation of circular fronts.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V2M-4FN76M9-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&vie w=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cfc0aa9de1373cb460ce2ee30192ecc1

Extras
11.img(Encryption) A new method for visual multimedia content encryption using cellular automata. The encryption scheme  is based on the application of an attribute of the CLF XOR filter, according to which the original content of a cellular  neighborhood can be reconstructed following a predetermined number of repeated applications of the filter. The  encryption is achieved using a key image of the same dimensions as the image being encrypted. This technique is  accompanied by the one-time pad (OTP) encryption method, rendering the proposed method reasonably powerful, given the  very large number of resultant potential security keys. The proposed method is further strengthened by the fact that the  resulting encrypted image for a given key image is different each time, since its result depends on a random number  generator.
A semi-blind source separation algorithm is used to decrypt the encrypted image. The result of the decryption is a  loss-less representation of the encrypted image. Simulation results for grayscale and color images demonstrate the  effectiveness of the proposed encryption method.
