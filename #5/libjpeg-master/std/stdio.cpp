    This project implements a complete(!) JPEG (10918-1 ITU.T-81) codec,
    plus a library that can be used to encode and decode JPEG streams. 
    It also implements ISO/IEC 18477 aka JPEG XT which is an extension
    towards intermediate, high-dynamic-range lossy and lossless coding
    of JPEG. In specific, it supports ISO/IEC 18477-3/-6/-7/-8 encoding.
